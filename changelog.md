      -  Coward (move_m@coward) - Hunched forward when standing still, other wise not diffrent from the default male walk.
      -  Dave (move_characters@dave_n) - Shoulders are higher then normal walk, standing wide when still, left foot hurting when running/jogging (sprint is the default one) (Used by Dave Norton in storymode)
      -      Femme2 (move_m@femme@) - Shoulders are "swinging", left leg is leaned on when standing still, generally can be best described as a feminine walk for male peds, run and sprint are like the default one (This is one of the avalible walks in GTA Online)
      -      Jimmy (move_characters@jimmy) - Similar to nervous/slow (they are all from the same character afterall), but with out the nervous or slow part (walks normal speed and not tripping with legs when standing still) (Used by Jimmy, the son of Michael in storymode)
      -      Patricia (move_characters@patricia) - Swinging with hips, straight/stiff back, run/sprint is similar to the default female one (Used by Patricia Madrazo in storymode)
      -      Ron (move_characters@ron) - Entire body posture slightly hanging to the left, runs like an idiot, sprint is normal. (Used by Ronald "Ron" Jakowski in storymode)
      -      Swagger2 (move_m@swagger@b) - Confident and somewhat slow walking, moving slightly to the right every so often, run an sprint is normal.
      -      Gangster6 (move_f@gangster@ng) - Slight diffrent in walking speed, posture is noticible diffrent, arms are more straight when standing still.
      -      Veryslow (move_m@leaf_blower) - Head looking down, walking very slowly, running with right arm as if he had a leaf blower, sprint is normal.
      -      Flee5 (move_m@flee@c) - Similar to Flee4, but multiple diffrences like how many times he turns his head to look behind etc.
      -      Floyd (move_characters@floyd) - Slightly leaned forward when walking, shoulders are high up when running.
      -      Hurry3 (move_f@hurry@b) - A more paranoid version then move_f@hurry@a.

      -      Tracey (move_characters@tracey) - Left foot hurting, swings excessively with arms, idles with left foot forwards.
   -added exit emotes to emote menu: This would add the option to add "exit emotes" for any emote. The point of adding this would be to allow for more "smooth" or "dynamic" animations to be set up, hopefully improving the "natural flow" when using emotes. Further down the line entry emotes could also be added to build on top of this.

   - updates to the following scripts and assets:
       - 919 Admin
       - cd Carhud
       - cd garage: 
         - Add:
        - Added search option to quick and impound menu
         - Vehicles can now be searched by name, location, plate or manufacturer
         - Added option to allow multiple jobs to use the JobRestricted garages
         - Added a staff command to change the plate of the vehicle you are in. This will allow custom plates to be used
          - Added logs for the vehicle management commands
          - Added a new function called SetFuel(), (just under the GetFuel() function) to the client_customise_me which will make adding compatibility with fuel scripts much easier. The read me has also been updated
         - Added a check for the /vehicle-plate command to make sure you can not change a plate to one that already exists
         - Added the vehicle labels to the transfer vehicle webhooks (ONLY when used from the chat command)
         - Added the ability to rename all esx events such as the setjob and playerloaded events
         - When using the regular job garage we had added the ability to restrict cars to certain job grades
         - Added the ability to have dedicated car/air/boat garages for job garages. This will work with all 3 types of job garages
         - Added an event that you can trigger after a player purchases a vehicle and it will update the garage_type in the database
         - Added an event that you can trigger after purchasing a job vehicle and it will set the vehicle as a job owned vehicle (you can choose if you want this vehicle to be personal owned or society owned)
         - Added full locales to the discord logs so you no longer need to redo them every time the file is updated
            - Edit
          - Updated quick menu design
          - Added extra code to auto fix errors caused by the wrong formatting of QBCore's shared vehicle file.

          - Improved load time of quick menu
          - Major optimisation of the client side ms usage
          - Updated all of the styling of the logs
          - If you have added jobs to a JobRestricted garage, only people with said job(s) will be able to see this blip. It will also display which jobs this location is restricted to on the blip
          - Reworked the job cars garage to use the drawtextui instead of chat commands
          - Reworked the personal owned job vehicles. To make a vehicle a personal owned job vehicle you will need to set the new column in the database 'job_personalowned' to 1. Meaning you no longer need to add all of the personal owned job vehicles to a table in the config
          - Simplified the whole job garage system in the config so its easier to understand
          - Updated the codesign error handlers

          - Reworked the use of the "vehicles" database table. We now get the vehicle display name, vehicle price, vehicle class and the garage tax amount for each vehicle
          - Updated the impound UI to the new system of getting the vehicle labels from the database if possible so it always shows the vehicles labels instead of the spawn names
          - Moved the webhooks to a server only file so it can not be dumped from the config
          - When impounding a vehicle, you can now choose to send the ID of the vehicle you wish to impound (so you can impound vehicles which are still on the back of tow trucks)
          - Changed the /vehicle-add command so you can not add a vehicle to the database if it is already owned by a player
          - Changed the /vehicle-delete so it does not log to discord if the vehicle is not owned by a player
            - Fix
           - Fixed an error with the save all vehicle damage events.
           - Fixed an issue with lockpicking vehicles.
           - Fixed an issue with saved vehicle keys.
